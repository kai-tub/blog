    "Before we can dive into multi-spectral satellite images, I think a quick refresher on how images\n",
    "are encoded and represented in memory is a good starting point.\n",

    "## Binary encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a short recap of how classical computer vision images are encoded in memory.\n",
    "Internally a computer (ignoring quantum-computing) only works with binary numbers. A binary number is either a 0 or a 1, on or off.\n",
    "The value of such a binary number is called a *bit*.\n",
    "The smallest data-element is called a *byte*. A byte consists of 8 bits.\n",
    "There are different ways how we could use these 8 bits/1 byte to encode our data.\n",
    "The data we are trying to store/load defines how we interpret the data. \n",
    "If we want to only work with positive integers, we use an unsigned integer type.\n",
    "An unsigned integer with 8 bits can encode all numbers from 0$-$255.\n",
    "If all bits are 1, also called *set*, the value is 255.\n",
    "If all bits are 0 the corresponding value is 0.{% fn 1 %}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grayscale images\n",
    "Images, like everything in a computer, are also only encoded in binary values.\n",
    "The most straightforward images are grayscale images. The possible colors of each pixel of a grayscale image can only range from black to gray to white, with all different gray shades in-between. \n",
    "*Pixels* are the basic elements of a picture. The word itself, [pixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Etymology), is a combination of the words picture and element/cell. So an image consists of pixels, similar to how a brick wall consists of bricks."

    "We only have a single channel for a grayscale image, the\n",
    "colors range from black to white. (We will take a closer look at different channels in the next post.)\n",
    "For now, we note that our grayscale channel is encoded with 8-bits. Or, put differently, we use 8-bits for every pixel to show different shades of gray. With 8-bits, we can color each pixel in 256 (2⁸) different ways.\n",
