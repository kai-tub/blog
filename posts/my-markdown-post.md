This is an example page, where I use some $\LaTeX$ and link to an image.
$\alpha$

<!-- TEASER_END -->

# Image with a caption lLiI
<figure>
  <img alt="This is a goose (I think)" src="/assets/images/goose.jpg" />
  <figcaption>This is a goose (I think)</figcaption>
</figure>

How is this working?

And then, I am also going to test some features from `htmx`.
The math supports looks actually quite nice. :smile:
