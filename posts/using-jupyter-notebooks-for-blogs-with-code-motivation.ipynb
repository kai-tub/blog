    "## Why Jupyter Notebooks for Blogs\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so let's say you want to blog about your daily life as a developer and frequently show code snippets.\n",
    "The idea is that you want to share the code with other people who can copy and run it.\n",
    "Maybe to learn from your experience or, in my case, from past mistakes.{{% Footnote %}}Wait, is this how experience is defined?{{% /Footnote %}}\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be _disastrous_{{% Footnote %}}Ok, maybe not _disastrous_, but at least annoying and not what you would like your readers to experience.{{% /Footnote %}} if the reader finds a bug or the code isn't complete and doesn't compile.\n",
    "So, let's say you first write the code in a separate file, ensure that it works, and then copy it into your HTML/Markdown file that is later converted to a blog post.\n",
    "You know that the code works as expected. You publish it, and months after publishing, a subscriber recommends a minor change to the example code.\n",
    "The original code is maybe lost, or you don't feel the need to test it again, and then a wild tipo appears.\n",
    "And we have a broken example on our page again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario is maybe a contrived example and doesn't happen too frequently. Still, for me, the separation of written content and code is, blatantly put, annoying.\n",
    "Depending on how complicated the presented code is or the underlying dependencies, there are many more possible sources for bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you want to ensure that the code runs with the newest dependencies or language versions to stay up-to-date.\n",
    "Or you simply never want to allow broken code to make it to your page.\n",
    "My solution is to use Jupyter Notebooks!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more benefits of using Jupyter to write these types of blog posts:\n",
    "- Only requires you to keep one window open during the writing process\n",
    "- The code and the blog content are stored together: No need to search through old folders for the test or code that produced a visual output\n",
    "- Interactive graphs such as those from [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html), [holoviews](http://holoviews.org/index.html), or [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) (usually) work right out of the box\n",
    "- It is possible to have some _personal_ notes next to the code but still hidden from the published page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially being able to document parts right next to the _blog content_ is quite helpful.\n",
    "I frequently remember seeing an _old_ bug, but not remembering how I've solved it back then.\n",
    "Or why I've decided to do it one way and not the other.\n",
    "Before we move on, let's see a couple of examples (aside from what we've seen until now, because the current page is actually a notebook.
